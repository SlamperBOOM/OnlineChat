"blocks" in BlocksGetter classes should look like XML, but without "<>".
If you want to add attribute to block, put "attr" and "*attr name*" + "*attr value*". Parser in Message.java will transform this into correct xml form.
Also if you want to put value in block, put "value" and "*value*".

With this rules, if you want to get xml file like this:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<success name=yes>
	<session>25</session>
</success>

Your list of String should look like
"success", "attr", "name", "yes", "session", "value", "25", "/session", "/success"
